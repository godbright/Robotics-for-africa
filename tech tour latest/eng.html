<h3> Who is the engineer</h3>
<hr>
 <div id="aside">
      <img src="e8.jpg"width="450px">
</div>
An engineer uses science, technology and math to solve problems. We can see engineering everywhere in the world around us, improving the ways we work, travel, communicate, stay healthy, and entertain. Today, the field of engineering offers more career choices than any other discipline.
</p>


<h3>What does the engineer do?</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Engineers design machinery, build skyscrapers, and oversee public works, but they address society's needs and problems on so many other levels as well. At a molecular level, they work on drug delivery systems that work inside cells. At a macro level, they quantify the particle flow of pollutants through soil to clean up oil spills, abandoned industrial sites and other biohazards. At a galactic level, they are designing spacecraft for other-planet exploration. At an atomic level, they are developing data storage that focuses on the spin of electrons in atoms. Clean drinking water, safe food storage, and the protection of our environment are also under the domain of the engineer.
<h3>The following are types of engineers </h3>
<hr>


<b>Aerospace Engineer</b><p>
- directs and coordinates the design, manufacture, and testing of aircraft and aerospace products
<br>
<b>Agricultural Engineer</b><p>
- analyzes agricultural operations and looks at new technologies and ways of doing things to improve land use, increase yields, and conserve resources
<br>
<b>Biochemical Engineer</b><p>
- develops new chemical products that can be used by a multitude of companies and individuals
<br>
<b>Biofuel Manufacturing Research Engineer</b><p>
- selects, tests, and recommends equipment and process improvements for the production of alternative fuel

<b>Biomedical Engineer</b><p>
- analyzes and designs solutions to problems in biology and medicine
<br>
<b>Chemical Engineer</b><p>
- conceptualizes and designs processes for producing, transforming and transporting materials
<br>
<b>Civil Engineer</b><p>
- designs and supervises large construction projects, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment
<br>
<b>Computer Hardware Engineer</b><p>
- researches, designs, develops, and tests computer equipment such as chips, circuit boards, or routers
<br>
<b>Computer Systems Engineer</b><p>
- provides advice to clients regarding the appropriate hardware and/or software to ensure that their computer systems meet their needs
<br>
Electrical Engineer</b><p>
- designs and develops new electrical equipment, solves problems and tests equipment
<h3>How can i become an Engineer</h3>
<p>When in high school, it is important to have a strong interest and foundation in the sciences and in mathematics.
 <p>If a student has a strong desire and a high level of curiosity to make the world a better place, and is excited by the thought of taking on the world's toughest challenges, <p>then becoming an engineer may be a sure fit. Most high school students have never spoken to a practicing engineer, <p>and it is strongly advisable to do so before deciding to go down the engineering path. <p>Whether civil, electrical, mechanical or another area, engineering majors are very demanding and take approximately five years to complete, <p>therefore it is critical to know something about engineering as a field and what an engineer does before deciding.<p>
